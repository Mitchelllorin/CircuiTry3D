Hi [First Name],

I wanted to reach out about a strategic opportunity that could benefit both CircuiTry3D and [Company Name].

CircuiTry3D is an educational circuit simulator designed for students, educators, and STEM organizations. We simulate circuit behavior in a clean, accessible interface—and we're building out our Component Arena to feature realistic 3D models of real-world components.

**Why I'm reaching out to [Company Name] specifically:**

Your components are industry standards. Students learning on CircuiTry3D should be learning with accurate representations of what they'll actually use in labs and careers. We'd like to explore a deeper partnership:

- **Custom 3D Models:** We'll develop accurate models of your key product lines
- **API Integration:** Real-time specs, pricing, or inventory from your systems
- **Joint Marketing:** Co-branded campaigns targeting STEM educators
- **Educator Programs:** Direct outreach to teachers using your physical kits

This goes beyond advertising. It's about shaping how the next generation of engineers and makers first encounter [Company Name] products.

I'd welcome a conversation with whoever handles educational partnerships or brand marketing at [Company Name]. Would you be able to point me in the right direction, or would a brief call work for you?

Best,
