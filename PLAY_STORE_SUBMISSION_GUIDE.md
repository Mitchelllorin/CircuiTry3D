## üîß Step 1: Build the Android App Bundle (AAB)

### Option A: Using Android Studio (Recommended)

1. **Open the project in Android Studio:**
   ```bash
   cd android
   # Open this directory in Android Studio
   ```

2. **Sync Gradle files:**
   - Click "File" ‚Üí "Sync Project with Gradle Files"
   - Wait for sync to complete

3. **Build the signed AAB:**
   - Click "Build" ‚Üí "Generate Signed Bundle / APK"
   - Select "Android App Bundle"
   - Click "Next"
   
4. **Configure signing:**
   - Key store path: `android/app/keystore/circuitry3d-release.keystore`
   - Key store password: `circuitry3d123`
   - Key alias: `circuitry3d`
   - Key password: `circuitry3d123`
   - Click "Next"
   
5. **Choose build variant:**
   - Select "release"
   - Check "Build Variants" is set to "release"
   - Click "Finish"

6. **Locate your AAB:**
   - The AAB will be in: `android/app/build/outputs/bundle/release/app-release.aab`
   - Copy this file to a safe location

### Option B: Using Command Line

1. **Navigate to the Android directory:**
   ```bash
   cd /home/runner/work/CircuiTry3D/CircuiTry3D/android
   ```

2. **Build the release AAB:**
   ```bash
   ./gradlew bundleRelease
   ```

3. **Verify the build:**
   - Check for: `android/app/build/outputs/bundle/release/app-release.aab`
   - File size should be approximately 5-15 MB

4. **Verify signing:**
   ```bash
   jarsigner -verify -verbose -certs app/build/outputs/bundle/release/app-release.aab
   ```

### Troubleshooting Build Issues

**Issue: Gradle sync failed**
```bash
# Clean and rebuild
./gradlew clean
./gradlew bundleRelease
```

**Issue: Missing Android SDK**
- Install Android Studio and Android SDK
- Set ANDROID_HOME environment variable
- Update `local.properties` with SDK path

**Issue: Java version mismatch**
```bash
# Check Java version (needs 17+)
java -version

# Set JAVA_HOME if needed
export JAVA_HOME=/path/to/java-17
```
