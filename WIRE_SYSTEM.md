# Wire System Architecture

This document describes the robust wire topology system implemented for CircuiTry3D.

## Overview

The wire system provides deterministic node-and-wire topology with automatic junction creation, selectable wiring modes (Freeform, Schematic, Star, and Routing), snap-to-pin functionality, and connectivity tracking for circuit simulation.

## Core Concepts

### Nodes
Nodes are connection points in the circuit. There are three types:

1. **Component Pins** (`componentPin`): Fixed connection points on circuit components
2. **Junctions** (`junction`): Auto-created when wires cross within tolerance or when the builder clicks any point along an existing wire
3. **Wire Anchors** (`wireAnchor`): Free endpoints of wires not connected to anything

### Wires
Wires are polylines connecting nodes. Each wire:
- Has an ordered list of points (`Vec2[]`)
- Tracks attached node IDs for every node it touches (endpoints and mid-line junctions)
- Can be split by inserting junction points mid-segment—both automatically (intersections) and manually (click-to-branch)

### Connectivity Graph
The system maintains an adjacency graph where:
- Nodes are vertices
- Wires form edges between connected nodes
- Union-Find algorithm identifies connected components

### Wiring Modes

| Mode | Behaviour |
| --- | --- |
| **Freeform** | Draws a straight segment between the chosen endpoints—ideal for quick sketches. |
| **Schematic** | Generates 90° elbow paths. Hold `Shift` while dragging to flip the elbow orientation on the fly. |
| **Star** | Inserts a graceful radial bend, useful for hub-and-spoke layouts. |
| **Routing** | Uses grid-based A* routing (with node-aware obstacles) to auto-thread a tidy path between endpoints. |

Each mode is available from the left-side Wire Mode panel in the Builder UI and is also exposed via the `WireDrawer` component.

## Configuration Constants

```typescript
const SNAP_RADIUS = 12;           // px - snap to pins/junctions
const INTERSECT_TOLERANCE = 4;    // px - junction creation threshold
const MERGE_RADIUS = 6;           // px - merge duplicate nodes
```

## Key Algorithms

### Segment Intersection
Uses the standard 2D line segment intersection algorithm:
```typescript
segmentIntersect(A, B, C, D) -> Vec2 | null
```
Returns intersection point if segments AB and CD cross.

### Point Projection
Projects a point onto a line segment:
```typescript
projectPointOnSegment(P, A, B) -> Vec2
```
Clamps parameter t to [0, 1] to stay within segment bounds.

### Junction Creation
When drawing a wire:
1. Check each segment against existing wires
2. If intersection detected within `INTERSECT_TOLERANCE`
3. Create (or reuse) a junction node at the intersection point
4. Split both wires by inserting the junction

### Node Merging
After any topology change:
1. Find node pairs within `MERGE_RADIUS`
2. Merge their wire attachments and positions (respecting priority pin > junction > anchor)

### Connectivity Rebuild
After topology changes:
```typescript
rebuildAdjacencyForWires(wires, nodes) -> AdjacencyGraph
```
1. Build position-to-node lookup
2. For each wire, find nodes at endpoints
3. Create bidirectional edges in adjacency graph
4. Update wire.attachedNodeIds

## Usage Example

```typescript
import { WireDrawer } from './ui/wire-drawer';
import { createNode } from './model/node';

function MyCircuitEditor() {
  const [wires, setWires] = useState([]);
  const [nodes, setNodes] = useState([
    createNode('componentPin', { x: 100, y: 100 }),
    createNode('componentPin', { x: 300, y: 100 })
  ]);

  return (
    <WireDrawer
      width={600}
      height={600}
      wires={wires}
      nodes={nodes}
      onWiresChange={setWires}
      onNodesChange={setNodes}
      mode={mode}
    />
  );
}
```

## Integration with Existing Circuit Builder

The wire system is designed to be integrated into `public/legacy.html`:

1. **Data Migration**: Existing wire data can be converted:
   ```typescript
   // Old format: { points: Vec2[] }
   // New format: Wire with attachedNodeIds
   
   function migrateOldWire(oldWire) {
     const wire = createWire(oldWire.points);
     const startNode = createNode('wireAnchor', wire.points[0]);
     const endNode = createNode('wireAnchor', wire.points[wire.points.length - 1]);
     wire.attachedNodeIds.add(startNode.id);
     wire.attachedNodeIds.add(endNode.id);
     return { wire, nodes: [startNode, endNode] };
   }
   ```

2. **Simulation Integration**: Use connectivity graph for current flow:
   ```typescript
   const graph = rebuildAdjacencyForWires(wires, nodes);
   const components = findConnectedComponents(graph);
   // Each component is an isolated circuit
   ```

3. **Component Movement**: Update wire endpoints when components move.

## Performance Considerations

- **Spatial Hash**: Use `SpatialHash` for O(1) proximity queries with large node counts
- **Incremental Updates**: Only rebuild connectivity for affected wires
- **Canvas Rendering**: Batch render calls, use requestAnimationFrame
- **Target**: 200+ wires on mobile devices remain responsive

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements:
- Wire labels and annotations
- Wire bundling for parallel connections
- Undo/redo support for junction edits
- Serialization for save/load (persisting mode selections and junction metadata)
